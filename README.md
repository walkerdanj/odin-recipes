The Odin Project: HTML Foundations Project
This project will showcase what I have learned from completing the HTML Foundation lessons on TOP
When I have completed it I will have demonstrated an understading of HTML boilerplates, tags and attributes. I will also have shown my understanding of absolute and relative links, and how file structure works. I will also be using command line when possible to cement my early understanding of commands and how they can be used.
